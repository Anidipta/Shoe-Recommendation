# Shoe Recommendation System

A comprehensive shoe recommendation and personalized service system designed to provide tailored suggestions based on user interaction patterns, preferences, and shoe care history.

## Overview

This system implements a hybrid recommendation approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to deliver accurate shoe recommendations. It also provides personalized services including proactive care notifications and wear pattern analysis.

## Features

### Recommendation Engine
- **Hybrid Algorithm**: Combines collaborative filtering (user-item interactions) with content-based filtering (shoe attributes)
- **Multiple Recommendation Types**: 
  - Similar shoes based on user preferences
  - Complementary shoes for outfit completion
  - Seasonal recommendations based on weather patterns
- **Real-time Processing**: Efficient algorithms for quick recommendation generation

### Personalized Services
- **Proactive Care Notifications**: Smart alerts based on shoe usage and care history
- **Wear Pattern Analysis**: Insights into user's shoe usage patterns
- **Replacement Suggestions**: Predictive recommendations for shoe replacement
- **Seasonal Adaptation**: Weather-aware recommendations

## Algorithm Choice Justification

**Hybrid Approach Selected** combining:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Identifies users with similar shoe preferences and recommends shoes liked by similar users
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends shoes with similar attributes to previously liked items
3. **Matrix Factorization**: Uses SVD for dimensionality reduction and latent feature discovery

**Rationale**:
- Overcomes cold start problem through content-based component
- Leverages community wisdom through collaborative filtering
- Handles sparse data efficiently with matrix factorization
- Provides explainable recommendations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shoe-recommendation-system.git
cd shoe-recommendation-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the database (optional):
```bash
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f schema.sql
```

## Usage

### Data Format

The system expects the following data formats:

#### User Interactions (CSV)
```csv
user_id,shoe_id,interaction_type,timestamp,rating
1,101,view,2024-01-15 10:30:00,
1,102,purchase,2024-01-16 14:20:00,5
```

#### Shoe Catalog (JSON)
```json
{
  "shoe_id": 101,
  "brand": "Nike",
  "model": "Air Max 90",
  "type": "sneakers",
  "material": "leather",
  "color": "white",
  "care_requirements": ["regular_cleaning", "waterproofing"]
}
```

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
The PostgreSQL schema includes:
- **users**: User profile information
- **shoes**: Comprehensive shoe catalog
- **user_interactions**: All user-shoe interactions
- **shoe_care_history**: Device-based care tracking
- **recommendations**: Stored recommendation results

### Algorithm Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes ratings, creates feature vectors
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Computes user-user and item-item similarities
3. **Prediction Generation**: Combines multiple signals for final recommendations
4. **Post-processing**: Applies business rules, diversity, and freshness filters

## Performance Considerations

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle millions of users and shoes
- **Real-time**: Sub-second response times for recommendation requests
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized data structures and caching strategies
- **Batch Processing**: Periodic model updates and precomputed similarities

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python test.py
```
